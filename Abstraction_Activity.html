						</header>

						<br><br><br>
						For our abstraction activity, we will be working on a project in Scratch. Scratch is a
						 high level, free to use block-based programming language created with javascript. As a block based programming language, it
						 already utilizes a large degree of abstraction. For example, each Scratch project consists of one or more "Sprites",
						 each of which have their own space for the programmer to add code. Each individuak "Block" of code is an 
						 abstraction of the javascript code that carries out the function. For example, the 
						 
						 <img src="images/lessonimages/move_block.png" width=10% height=10%>
							
						block tells the "Sprite" to move a certain number of steps. Simple, right? Well, looking deeper, the "move" block 
						 is an abstraction of several lines of javascript code that remove the image of the sprite from the screen, and
						 replaces it in the new location. Those Javascript lines are themselves abstractions of the base machine language 
						 that computers run on into something easier for humans to read and understand.
						 
						<br><br>
						For this project, will be creating a sort of rock-papper-scissors battle royal, in which a set number of rock,
						 papper, and scissor sprites "battle" eachother, and the loser becomes the winning type. The winner will be
						 determined by traditional rock-papper-scissors rules, thus rock cruches scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper
						 covers rock. Bellow, I have a working example so you know what you are working towards: 
						 <br>
							<body>
								<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/924530060/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</body>
						<p>
							
							<br><br><br>
							
							This project will be divided into two parts: to create a working project, and to use abstraction
							 to make the code as simple and easy to understand as possible. A sample code has been provided for you
							 to work on here:
							<br>
							 <body>
								<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/930705773/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</body>
							 
							 <br>

							 <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/930705773/editor/" target="_blank" >	<button class = "button button_lvl1">   <font color = "black">Code</font> </button>	</a>
							 <br> <br>


							 <h3><b>Phase 1: Encapsulation</b></h3>
							 <br>
							 As you can see, while several "clones" of the origional sprite are created, only the origional is moving. While we can
							 just copy/paste the first sprite and remove the clone generation to have a working game, that is both wasteful of space, and hard to edit.
							 After all, if you made a mistake, you would have to fix it 15 times, and if you missed one, you would have to hunt through
							 all of them to find it. Thus, abstraction. Having all of the code in one class (sprite) with multiple instances
							 of itself (clones) instead of duplicating the code many times for the same effect is an example of Encapsulation.

							 <br>

							 Your first step will be to have the generated clones move themselves. For this, scratch already provides this with the handy block 
							 <img src="images/lessonimages/start_as_clone_block.png" width=10% height=10%>. The "When I start as a clone" block is one of
							 several control blocks. Control blocks sense when a condition is met, such as if the start button is pressed or
							 if the current instance just started as a clone, and immediately executes all the code connected to it. For you to use it, simply
							 navigate to the control blocks on the left hand side and drag the "When I start as a clone" block into the code section.
							 From there, drag the forever block and its contents from its origional location to the WISAAC block. The forever block
							 is exactly what it sounds like: it will execute the code inside of it forever, untill it is fored to stop with the end button.

							 <br>
							 Once you have done this, it should behave similar to this:
							 <br>
							 <body>
								<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/930762993/embed"  allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</body>
							<br><br>
							Now, if you are paying attention, you will notice three major errors with how the code is currently functioning:
							<ul>
								<li>Clones do not wait for the others to generate before starting.</li>
								<li>The origional sprite does not move.</li>
								<li>With the origional sprite, there are 31 players instead of the intended 30 (10 per team).</li>
							  </ul>  
							
							<br> 

							To correct these, there are a few things you can do. First, use the "hide" block in the looks section before the clones are
							 generated. Then, instead of the "When I start as clone" block, instad use a combinstion of the 
							 <img src="images/lessonimages/broadcast_block.png" width=10% height=10%> block, which sends out a signal to all
							 sprites (including clones), and the <img src="images/lessonimages/receive_block.png" width=10% height=10%> block,
							 which is a control block that starts when it gets that signal. Finally, add a "show" block, found in the same location
							 as the hide block, at the beginning of the code under the receive block, to make all active clones visible. 
							 <br><br>
							 Because the origional sprite was the one to send the broadcast, it will not trigger the recieve block itself, only the clones.
							 Once you are finished, the project should function similarly to the working example shown at the beginning of this page. If you feel that 
							 it starts too abrubtly, feel free to add a small waight block right after the show block. Regardless, congradulations, you have completed
							 the Encapsulation portion of this project!


							 <br><br><br>
							 <h3><b>Phase 2: Procedural Abstraction</b></h3>
							 
							 By this point, your code should loke somewhat similar to this: 
							 <br>
							 <button onclick="toggle(this)">Hide picture</button>
							<picture hidden id="mypicture">
								<img src="images/lessonimages/abstraction_code_1.png" width=100% height=100%>
							  </picture>
							  
							  <br /><br />
							  
							  
							  <script>
								let toggle = button => {
								  let element = document.getElementById("mypicture");
								  let hidden = element.getAttribute("hidden");
								  
								  if (hidden) {
									 element.removeAttribute("hidden");
									 button.innerText = "Hide picture";
								  } else {
									 element.setAttribute("hidden", "hidden");
									 button.innerText = "Show picture";
								  }
								}
							  </script>
							<h3><b>Example Maze</b></h3>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/lessonimages/Recursive_Act_Unsolved_Maze.png" alt="" 
								height=50%
								width=50%/>
								<br>
							
							To make this activity simpler, no maze will have any loops. Because of this, we can derive the 
							optimal path from any valid solution. To find a solution, we used the "follow the left wall" maze strategy.
							That is, it will move through the maze, and at every fork, it will always choose to turn left if it can. If it can't, 
							then it will try to go straight, then right if it fails, then finally backwards if it is the only option.
							Because there are no loops, it will always find the finish eventually. As it moves
							through the maze, it will keep track of all decisions so that we can reduce it later.

								<h3><b>Mapped Maze</b></h3>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/lessonimages/Recursive_Act_Mapped_Maze.png" alt="" 
								height=50%
								width=50%/>
								<br>

							  
							As we are testing your ability
							to implement a recursive algorithm, and not your knowledge of maze solving, we give you all possible 
							optimizations for three sequential movements:

							<ul>
								<li>Left -> Back -> Right = Back</li>
								<li>Left -> Back -> Straight = Right</li>
								<li>Right -> Back -> Left = Back</li>
								<li>Straight -> Back -> Left = Right</li>
								<li>Straight -> Back -> Straight = Back</li>
								<li>Left -> Back -> Left = Straight</li>
							  </ul>  

							
							<h3><b>optiMAZE Block</b></h3>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/lessonimages/Recursive_Act_optiMAZE_block.png" alt="" 
								height=20%
								width=20%/>
								<br>

							What you will be doing in this activity is taking the long path that was mapped, and 
							create a recursive algorithm to reduce it to the optimal path. You will do this by completing the optiMAZE block in the 
							Mouse Sprite. We provided 4 different difficulty levels: 
							
							<ul>
								<li>Easy: Already optimizes the path once. You need to make it repeatedly 
									optimize it until it stops improving</li>
								<li>Medium: Tests the first three moves for a possible reduction (see list ablove).
									You need to test every sequence of three moves in the path for possible reduction
									then repeat the entire thing until it no longer shortens the path</li>
								<li>Hard: Tests the first three moves for a possible reduction of Left -> Back -> Right = Back.
									You need to test for every possible reduction (see list ablove) for every sequence of three moves in the path,
									then repeat the entire thing until it no longer shortens the path</li>
								<li>Insane: optiMAZE is empty. You will need to implement the entire block yourself.</li>
							</ul>
